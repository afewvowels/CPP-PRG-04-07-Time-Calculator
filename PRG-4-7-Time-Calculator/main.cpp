//  Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds
//
//  * There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
//    greater than or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minutes in
//    that many seconds.
//  * There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
//    greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display the number of hours in
//    that many seconds.
//  * There are 86,400 seconds in an day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
//    greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of days in
//    that many seconds.
